In the SkteTokenIcoContract.sol file, there are some lines which can be updated once ICO will be started.

First, line 37 for start time.
    startTime = _startTime; // 1530450000 2018-07-01 9:AM EDT
    _startTime should be updated and this should be the start time. as you can see, the type of _startTime is Timestamp, and UTC Time zone.

Second, line 38 for end time.
    endTime = _endTime; // 1535806800 2018-09-01 9:AM EDT
    This is same with the case of _startTime.

    or uint256 public   rate = 200; this line 16.
    In this line, rate was set as 200 initially, so you can set using this line, too, of course , before it will be deployed.

Third, line 161 for setting token rate.
    function setRate(uint256 _rate) public onlyOwner returns (bool)
    Owner can set rate using this function.
    This function check the time when it is between _startTime and _endTime.(require (now >= startTime && now <= endTime);)
